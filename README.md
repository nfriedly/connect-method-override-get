connect-method-override-get
===========================

Like [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)'s [methodOverride](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/methodOverride.html), 
except it supports GET requests also.


Security notice
---------------

On it's own, this is wildly insecure. There's a [good reason](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/169) 
it wasn't included in the main methodOverride, and using it is probably a bad idea unless you _really_ know what 
you're doing. At the very least, you should includ [CSRF](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/csrf.html)
protection with it.

Installation
------------------------

    npm install --save connect-method-override-get

Usage with a Connect app
-------------------------

    var app = connect();
    app.use(connect.bodyParser());
    app.use(require('methodOverrideGet')('_method'));

Usage with an Express app
-------------------------

    var app = express();
    app.use(express.bodyParser());
    app.use(require('methodOverrideGet')('_method'));
